				<h1>Blueberries!!</h1>
				<p id="top-text">The blueberry is a North American original.  Breeding the Northern Highbush with the Rabbiteye gave us the Southern Highbush.  Some varieties of the Southern Highbush have a very low chill hour requirement and can thrive in Southern California pumping out blueberries for as long as 50 years!</p>

					<h4>Great Variety(ies):</h4>
					<p>Figure out your chill hours, plant hardiness zone, soil type, etc... and then go learn all you can about which blueberries will thrive in your yard.
