				<h1>Grapes!!</h1>
				<p id="top-text">The grape berry is native to many parts of the world.  American, European, and American/European hybrid varieties are all grown in Southern California.  After 3 to 5 years, grapevines can produce grapes and continue to deliver nature's goodness for 50 to 100 years and sometimes even more!</p>

					<h2>Tips from Our Garden to Yours</h2>
					<h4>Great Variety(ies):</h4>
					<p>Figure out your chill hours, plant hardiness zone, soil type, etc... and then learn all you can about which strawberries will thrive in your yard.  Sequoia and Chandler have done very well in one of our sunny areas, while we are considering Alpine for some of our shadier areas.  Still so much to learn...</p>
					<h4>Great Spot(s):</h4>
					<p>Identify the amount of sunlight/shade, the exposure/protection from wind and elements, and any other factors pro and con for each spot in your yard.  As much as possible, match your great variety(ies) with your great spot(s).</p>
